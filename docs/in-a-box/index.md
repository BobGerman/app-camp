# Microsoft Teams App Camp "In a Box"

_Migrate applications into Microsoft Teams_

Teams App Camp is a self-paced, online workshop, but it also makes a great live workshop, either online on in person! The App Camp team has conducted several online workshops and we'd like to share our materials with you.

This material can be used to lead:

 * One-to-many hands-on bootcamps
 * Tailored hands-on labs for individual partners or customers
 * Internal training for enterprise development teams

## Preparing to teach App Camp

Teams App Camp is written for professional developers; students and especially instructors should feel comfortable coding in modern JavaScript and should understand the basics of RESTful web services. Please review the App Camp videos and do the labs - even if you're already an expert - so you know what's there for students.

You may also want to review the article [Understanding ISV's](https://github.com/microsoft/app-camp/wiki/Understanding-ISV's){target=_blank} in the [App Camp wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/app-camp/wiki/App-Camp-Wiki){target=_blank}. It compares the needs of enterprise developers, including systems integrators who build bespoke apps for enterprises, with the needs of ISV's who host Software as a Service applications.

## Introducing Students to Teams Applications

It's important to ensure students understand the basics of Teams applications and Azure AD before they begin the labs so they'll really understand what's going on. This material is contained in the ["Technical Briefing" videos on the App Camp main page](http://devpoint19.lab/app-camp/#video-briefings).

One option that can save time is to ask students to watch one or more of these videos as pre-work. We had success with this approach in live workshops, where we opened with a quiz on the Teams material.
