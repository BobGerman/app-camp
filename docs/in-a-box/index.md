# Microsoft Teams App Camp "In a Box"

_Migrate applications into Microsoft Teams_

Teams App Camp is a self-paced, online workshop, but it also makes a great live workshop, either online on in person! The App Camp team has conducted several online workshops and we'd like to share our materials with you.

This material can be used to lead:

 * One-to-many hands-on bootcamps
 * Tailored workshops for individual partners or customers
 * Internal training for enterprise development teams

## Preparing to teach App Camp

Teams App Camp is written for professional developers; students and especially instructors should feel comfortable coding in modern JavaScript and should understand the basics of RESTful web services. Please review the App Camp videos and do the labs - even if you're already an expert - so you know what's there for students.

You may also want to review the article [Understanding ISV's](https://github.com/microsoft/app-camp/wiki/Understanding-ISV's){target=_blank} in the [App Camp wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/app-camp/wiki/App-Camp-Wiki){target=_blank}. It compares the needs of enterprise developers, including systems integrators who build bespoke apps for enterprises, with the needs of ISV's who host Software as a Service applications.

## Planning your workshop

Four sample agendas are offered here, two for enterprise developers and two for ISV's (which include content on monetizing apps in the Teams app store and Microsoft App Source). Please don't feel the need to use them as-is! It's a lot better to understand your audience first, and then build an agenda tailored to their needs, so please mix and match, skip content that's not relevant, and add additional content as needed.

### Envisioning Workshop

The Envisioning Workshop is intended for business and technical audiences alike to help them envision a Teams application to be developed. It's structured for a single customer or partner, but it could be adapted for a larger audience. The goal is to envision one or more Teams apps, either as extensions of existing apps or as new ones, and to understand the business impact of these applications.

Envisioning Workshop sample agendas are here:

#### Discovery

The Envisioning agenda begins with Discovery - that is, discovering the situation. This includes reviewing existing apps that might be extended to Microsoft Teams, or work processes that could benefit from a Teams application. It's useful to hear from as many stakeholders as possible during this discussion and to ask the customer or partner to demonstrate existing applications. Ask what works well in this application or work process, and what doesn't work so well? Are there unmet opportunities? How do people collaborate when they're using this applicaiton or doing a work process? Are users going through extra steps unnecessarily?

Write it all down on a whiteboard (physical or virtual) so everyone knows their thoughts were heard, and to allow them to be reviewed and prioritized. Prioritize the issues and feature ideas as a group, and narrow it down to the top 2 or 3. Consider the impact if these issues could be addressed, or new features introduced - how would it help the end customer? Would it make people more productive, encourage collaboration or better decision-making, or perhaps reduce the risk of error inherent in human handoffs?

#### Opportunity to Grow with Microsoft Teams Apps (ISV's only)

This presentation explains the business opportunity for building Teams applications and selling them as SaaS applications in the Teams app store and Microsoft App Source. You can [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iho0LJrFp9s) or present it yourself.

<div>PowerPoint</div>

The presentation discusses three case studies of successful Teams apps:

1. Law Toolbox ([Case study](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/case-studies/lawtoolbox){target="_blank"}, [Video](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=success-stories){target="_blank"})

2. Breakthru ([Article](https://startups.microsoft.com/blog/breakthru-teams/){target="_blank"}, [video](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=success-stories){target="_blank"})

3. Mural ([Overview](https://mural.co/partners/microsoft/teams){target="_blank"}, [video](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=teams-app-opportunity){target="_blank"}

There are more video case studies [here](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=success-stories){target="_blank"}; select the ones that will be most relevant to your audience.






#### Microsoft Teams Application Overview

Following Discovery, everyone in the workshop should have a shared understanding of the present situation. In this segment, the workshop facilitator will explain how Teams apps work and what they can do. As you're doing this, constantly refer back to what you learned in Discovery - how could each feature be used to address the ideas that were discussed?

This deck contains a slide for each major capability of Teams applications, such as a personal tab or message extension, plus some general concepts such as Azure AD Single Sign-on. Each slide defines the concept along with a screen shot or other visual, and lists the end-user benefits that it brings.

<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=D6091E8599A50F25&amp;resid=D6091E8599A50F25%21577&amp;authkey=AOBmMVYxFUZvJA8&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777" width="476px" height="288px" frameborder="0">This is an embedded <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target="_blank" href="https://office.com/webapps">Office</a>.</iframe>

It's best to accompany each slide with a demonstration. You can use the completed App Camp labs, of course, however it's a pretty bare-bones application. It's really intended to teach the technical concepts, not to demonstrate business value. So including other demos is also a great idea.

A good sample to show is the Contoso HR Talent App, which presents a business scenario - recruiting new talent - that's familiar to many. The app includes all the major Teams app features, including more message extension options and bot features than App Camp. It's available in [.NET](https://github.com/OfficeDev/msteams-sample-contoso-hr-talent-app) and [NodeJS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/msteams-sample-contoso-hr-talent-app-node), and includes its own lab with setup instructions.

#### Envisioning whiteboard discussion

At this point, everyone in the room should understand the partner or customer's situation, any existing apps, and the capabilities of Teams apps. Now take the time to brainstorm ideas for how a Teams app might work. Could existing web pages become tabs? Would they be personal or shared? Could messaging extensions assist with handoffs or keep groups informed? Sketch the application and list use cases.

## Delivering your workshop


### Introducing Students to Teams Applications

It's important to ensure students understand the basics of Teams applications and Azure AD before they begin the labs so they'll really understand what's going on. This material is contained in the ["Technical Briefing" videos on the App Camp main page](http://devpoint19.lab/app-camp/#video-briefings).

One option that can save time is to ask students to watch one or more of these videos as pre-work. We had success with this approach in live workshops, where we opened with a quiz on the Teams material.
